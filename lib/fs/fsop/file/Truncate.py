File Truncate FS Operation
---------------------------

Purpose:
	Implements the POSIX truncate operation for files. This module provides a stateless,
	asynchronous functor that changes the size of a cached file.

Role in Architecture:
	- Utilizes the underlying CachedFileInode.truncate() method to adjust the file size.
	- Updates the local metadata and block cache accordingly.
	- Ensures consistency between the in-memory state and on-disk state after truncation.

Interface:
	- Expected input parameters:
		* upath: The universal path of the file.
		* io: The I/O object.
		* size: The new size of the file (in bytes).
	- Returns: None.
	- Must raise appropriate IOError on failure.

TODO/FIXMEs:
	- Ensure that truncating to a larger size pads the file with null bytes (possibly using NullString).
	- Add logging for debugging and error conditions.
