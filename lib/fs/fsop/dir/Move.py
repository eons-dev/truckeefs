Directory Rename FS Operation
-------------------------------

Purpose:
	Implements the renaming or moving of a directory. This FSOp updates the directory's
	cached inode and its parent's children list to reflect the new path.

Role in Architecture:
	- Updates both local metadata and the persistent database to reflect the renaming.
	- Coordinates with the remote Tahoe backend so that the directoryâ€™s remote capability
	  is updated if necessary.
	- Ensures that conflicts (e.g., target already exists) are handled properly.

Interface:
	- Expected input parameters:
		* src_upath: The universal path of the directory to rename.
		* dst_upath: The new universal path for the directory.
		* io: The I/O object.
	- Returns: A success indicator or the updated directory inode.
	- Must raise appropriate IOError if the operation fails.

TODO/FIXMEs:
	- Validate that the destination directory does not exist.
	- Integrate logging for debugging and error recovery.
	- Update parent directory cache and persistent storage accordingly.
