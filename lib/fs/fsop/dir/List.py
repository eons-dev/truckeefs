Directory List FS Operation
---------------------------

Purpose:
	Implements the directory listing operation. This FSOp retrieves the list of
	entries (files and subdirectories) in a given directory from the local cache.

Role in Architecture:
	- Acts as a wrapper around the CachedDirHandle.listdir() method.
	- Provides a standardized interface for FUSE (or other POSIX clients) to
	  obtain directory contents.
	- May integrate with caching logic to ensure that the directory listing
	  is up-to-date.

Interface:
	- Expected input parameters:
		* upath: The universal path of the directory.
		* io: The I/O object.
	- Returns: A list of directory entry names (or a list of dictionaries with attributes).
	- Must raise appropriate IOError if the directory does not exist or cannot be listed.

TODO/FIXMEs:
	- Consider adding support for pagination or filtering if needed.
	- Integrate logging for the listing operation and error conditions.
	- Verify that the returned format is compliant with FUSE expectations.
